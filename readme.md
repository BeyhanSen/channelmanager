## Open-Source Online Hotel Distribution Channel Manager Web-based Software and Application Interface (API)

This is an open-source project for an hotel channel management software, which is implemented using PHP and Laravel Framework. 

It is often difficult to provide two-way interfaces for all of the available online travel agencies and property management systems. There are several paid channel manager software but not much documentation, open-source projects or libraries. 

Hence, we believe that collaboration on this project with other developers would be helpful and we encourage them to contribute to the development of this open-source web-based online hotel distribution software.
